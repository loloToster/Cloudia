# About

<details open>
    <summary>
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    </summary>

The main goal of this app is to simplify the process of quick saving files and text. I found myself many times using some messenger apps like Discord to quickly save some images or pieces of text like links and pieces of code which I didn't want to clutter my desktop with. Or sending some files back to myself because I wanted them on my phone. This app solves all of the described things and is currently running 24/7 on my Raspberry Pi ðŸ™‚

Every uploaded file is represented as an item on the main page. By hovering over any item the user is presented with a mini menu that consists of some metadata of the file and two buttons: one that downloads the file and the other that deletes it. By clicking on the File Item the user is redirected to the [File Details Page](#file-details). Example of the file item:
